# Matrix Algebra for Engineers


## 1. 

This course is all about matrices, and concisely covers the linear algebra that an engineer should know.   The mathematics in this course is presented at the level of an advanced high school student, but it is recommended that students take this course after completing a university-level single variable calculus course.  There are no derivatives or integrals involved, but students are expected to have a basic level of mathematical maturity.  Despite this, anyone interested in learning the basics of matrix algebra is welcome to join.

The course consists of 38 concise lecture videos, each followed by a few problems to solve. After each major topic, there is a short practice quiz.  Solutions to the problems and practice quizzes can be found in the instructor-provided lecture notes.  The course spans four weeks, and at the end of each week, there is an assessed quiz.
