# Vector Calculus for Engineers


## 1. 

This course covers both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Vector Calculus. During the first week, students will learn about scalar and vector fields. In the second week, they will differentiate fields. The third week focuses on multidimensional integration and curvilinear coordinate systems. Line and surface integrals are covered in the fourth week, while the fifth week explores the fundamental theorems of vector calculus, including the gradient theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes' theorem. These theorems are essential for subjects in engineering such as Electromagnetism and Fluid Mechanics.

Note that this course may also be referred to as Multivariable or Multivariate Calculus or Calculus 3 at some universities. A prerequisite for this course is two semesters of single variable calculus (differentiation and integration).

The course includes 53 concise lecture videos, each followed by a few problems to solve. After each major topic, there is a short practice quiz. At the end of each week, there is an assessed quiz. Solutions to the problems and practice quizzes can be found in the instructor-provided lecture notes.
