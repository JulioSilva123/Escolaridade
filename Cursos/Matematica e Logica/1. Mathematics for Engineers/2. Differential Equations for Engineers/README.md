# Differential Equations for Engineers


## 1. 

This course is all about differential equations and covers both theory and applications. In the first five weeks, students will learn about ordinary differential equations, while the sixth week is an introduction to partial differential equations.

The course includes 56 concise lecture videos, with a few problems to solve after each lecture. After each major topic, there is a short practice quiz. At the end of each week, there is an assessed quiz. Solutions to the problems and practice quizzes can be found in the instructor-provided lecture notes.
